**Who is this for?**
- Job seekers wanting to know which skills to prioritize
- Students choosing between career paths
- Recruiters and HR professionals understanding market trends

1. Which job skills are most in demand in Ethiopia right now?
2. Which industries are hiring the most?
3. What is the salary range across different roles and sectors?
4. Which cities have the highest number of job postings?
5. What education level do most employers require?
6. How has demand for tech skills changed over time?

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Data collection from job boards requires careful standardization — job titles vary widely (e.g., "Data Analyst" vs "Analytics Specialist" vs "Reporting Analyst")
- Salary data is often missing from Ethiopian job postings, making salary analysis challenging
- Cleaning free-text skills fields (e.g., "MS Office, Excel, Word") requires consistent parsing logic

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] Automate data collection with Python web scraping
- [ ] Expand dataset to 500+ job postings
- [ ] Add time-series analysis to track skill demand monthly
- [ ] Compare Ethiopian market with other East African countries (Kenya, Rwanda)
- [ ] Deploy interactive dashboard on Power BI Service (public link)
